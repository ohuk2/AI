Code created with chatGPT:

I am a data visualization expert and would like to see how Covid spread across different countries. Please create a dashboard that I can use to explore the spread over time and across countries using publicly available data from WHO or other organizations.

This generated the code that could be copied-pasted into the "covid_dashboard.py"

Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8050/ to view the dashboard. You will see a dropdown menu to select countries and radio buttons to choose the type of data (confirmed, deaths, recovered). The graph will update dynamically based on your selections.
